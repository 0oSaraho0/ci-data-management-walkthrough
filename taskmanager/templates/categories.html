<!--Here we are starting by making a button to like the pages togehter This will take us to the form

12 spaces and is center aligned  within the link we add a button with the materalize button large class
which is larger than deafult.  the link is add category with an icon the link has the url for with double 
curly braces becasue it is a local file-->
<div class="row">
    <div class="col s12 center-align">
        <a href="{{ url_for('add_category') }}" class="btn-large light-blue darken-2"> 
            Add Category <i class="fas fa-plus-square right"></i>
        </a>

<!--Eventually, we are going to have more than one category listed here, but so far we've
only added the single category of 'Travel'.
However, let's prepare the code to recognize multiple cards, by using the Jinja syntax of a for-loop.
We don't want each card to stack on top of each other, but instead, to flow within the
same row, each having their own column.
Make sure to add the for-loop just inside of the row, so everything within the row is repeated and looped.
The closing  endfor  should be just after the div for this column, so follow that down,
and add the closing element there.
Similar to JavaScript, we need to define a new index for each iteration of this loop,
so to keep things consistent, we will call ours 'category'.
This means that for each 'category' in the ‘list of categories' being passed over from
our Python function, it will generate a new column and card.
Finally, we need to display the actual category name that's stored within our database, so
we can update the card-title.
Since we are within a for-loop, we need to use the newly defined index variable of 'category'.
We also need to use dot-notation and tell it which key should be printed here, so in
this case, it should be 'category.category_name', which means, “this category’s key of category_name”.
If you wanted to show the primary key instead, that's stored within our database as 'id',
so it would be 'category.id' for example.
That's all there is to it,-->
